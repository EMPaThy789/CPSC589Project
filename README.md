# CPSC589Project
Subdivision surface project for CPSC589

TODO list:
- Read verticies into half-edge data structure
- Fix rekt as frustrum/shape
- 3D subdivision (probably loop subdivision as it creates triangles instead of quads and nearly all meshes are triangl meshes)
- Basic render (probbably Phong)
- movement of frustrum
- Move control points
